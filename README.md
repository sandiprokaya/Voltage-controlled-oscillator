# Voltage-controlled-oscillator
here I have included the proteus design of the voltage controlled
frequency generator using 555 timers including executable File
user can change and interfere with the design in proteus as per requirements.
the design of the given circuit is based on the simulation, which doesnt match to the rating and values of the active and passive components available in the market, it in hardware the design should be compromised which can give irational result, so please once review the design and then move on.

THANK YOU!!!
