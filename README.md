# Voltage-controlled-oscillator
here i have include the prteus design of the voltage controlled
frequency genereator using 555 timer including execuitable File
user can change and interfere the design in proteus as per requirements.
the design of the given circuit is based on the simulation, which doesnt match to the rating and values of the active and passive components available in the market, it in hardware the design should be compromised which can give irational result, so please once review the design and then move on.

THANK YOU!!!!!
